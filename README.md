# Data Regression Analysis

## Overview
`DataRegression.py` is a Python script developed for a machine learning course assignment. It focuses on implementing regression analysis techniques to understand and predict data patterns. The script utilizes various Python libraries for data processing and visualization.

## Key Features
- Implementation of regression models.
- Use of libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
- Data visualization to illustrate regression results.
- Techniques for splitting data into training and test sets.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script `DataRegression.py`.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn


## Usage

The script can be executed to perform regression analysis on the dataset. It will process the data, apply regression models, and visualize the results.
